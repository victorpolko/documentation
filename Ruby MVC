# Ruby uses Model-View-Controller architecture with these types automatical generation

1. Create a controller
# To create a new controller

	$ cd [pathToProject]
	$ rails generate controller [controllerName]

# From now on there is a [controllerName]_controller in /[pathToProject]/app/controllers/

2. Define an action
# To define a new action within it
	def [actionName]
		[someActions]
	end

3. Create a view
# Then it is necessary to create a view in /[pathToProject]/app/views/[controllerName]/ with name=[actionName] and any content

4. Add a route to this view
# It is necessary to write a route to view in /[pathToProject]/config/routes.rb
# The main page is defined with
	root '[controllerName]#[viewName]'

# Any other view is added withinh a GET-request to a necessary view
	get '[controllerName]/[actionName]'
