# Customonokai Dark Theme
VS Code is not that smart for now, it doesn't allow custom color schemes (not themes!) per syntax, which is very useful in Sublime Text (yes, I'm still using that).

So I decided to copy styles from Monokai and customize them for Ruby separately. Yes, I can't deal with global things like the color of the background, but it's still closer to my truth.

There are a lot of things that can be tuned, but there are problems as well, like e.g. `class`, `do` and `def` are different textmate scopes, but `end` is same for both, so I don't see any sense in differentiating of `class` from `do` and `def`.
