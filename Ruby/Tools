1. To insert a Ruby-code into HTML
	#<% [someActions] %>
	#<%= [someActionsToPrint] %>

2. A HELPER link_to creates an <a> tag with some parameters
	#<%= link_to '[LinkName]', '[linkRef]' %>

3. To check all routes of project
	$ rake routes

4. It is possible to generate a [linkRef] with Ruby instruments
	#<%= link_to 'About', about_path %>
# It is good to check the code for errors: when some action cannot be found we'll see it in the log

5. Ruby allows to work with project at the console mode, in which it is possible to manage all defined actions, controllers, create records, update database etc.
# To run the console
	$ rails c
# To see all DB
	> Category.all
# To create a new record inside a variable (not in DB)
	> cat = Category.new
# This now may be changed in any way
	> cat.name = 'Phones'
# After session end every change that was not saved to DB will be lost.
	> cat.save
# It's possible to create a record in DB in one line
	> Category.create name: 'Phones'
# To delete first DB record
	> Category.all.first.destroy
# To find a record by id
	> Category.find(2)

6. Edit category
	edit_category_path(id: category.id)
	# This is because in routes /categories/:id/edit(.:format) there is a parameter for this

7. Delete something
	# link_to 'Delete something', @something, method: :delete, confirm:	'Sure?'

8. Symbol
	# Anything starting with ':' is called a symbol. It is always only 1 byte length in RAM
	:minimum => 3	# is the same as
	minimum: 3
