cap [servername] deploy

Severname is usually defined in some configs.

Capistrano creates two folders and a symlink:
  1. /releases with all deployed releases
  2. /shared for common files
  3. current as a symlink for last release

For any dynamical content it is necessary to write shared_children in deploy.rb. Otherwise all changes will be lost in the next deployment.
