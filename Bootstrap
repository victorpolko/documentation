# Bootstrap uses a module grid system, which divides the viewable area into 12 columns.

  <div class="row">                         #   This is a module row
    <div class="span8"><%= yield %></div>   #   span8 says that this div's width is 8/12 of 100%
    <div class="span4">Side chain</div>     #   span4 says that this div's width is 4/12 of 100%
  </div>                                    #

# Bootstrap advises to use a div.container to insert inner header, content (yield) and footer for this grid system to work.
