# We use nginx, sort of a filter between browser and main server (Unicorn). It forbids any unauthorised requests to main server for DDOS prevention.
# On server all configs for sites are collected in /etc/nginx/sites-available

# A config file usually contains some directives of which files will be available from the browser
